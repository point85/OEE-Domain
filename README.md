# OEE-Domain
This project comprises the business domain classes for Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) applications.  The classes enable:
* collection of equipment data from multiple sources to support OEE calculations, 
* resolution via JavaScript of a collected data value into an availability reason or produced material quantity to provide input to the performance, availability and quality components of OEE,
* calculation of the OEE key performance indicator (KPI) for the equipment using an optional  work schedule for defining the scheduled production time.

The OEE-Domain project's jar file is required by the Designer, Monitor, Collector, Operator and Operator Web OEE applications.  
For more information about the domain project, please refer to the *Overall Equipment Effectiveness Applications User Guide* in the OEE-Designer project's *docs* folder at https://github.com/point85/OEE-Designer.
